# Session-3

In this Assigment, the task is to acheive validation accuracy more than 99.4% on mnist data set by training a DNN with less than 20000 parameters.

I tried several architecture. Could acheive 99.08% at max ( without using any dropout / batch normalization etc. ).
Given below are the best model and second best model ((i could acheive)).


## Model1 :- validation Accuracy =99.08% with 15,650 parameters


## Model2 :- validation Accuracy =98.95% with 14,960 parameters
